## 📝 Changes Made

### Pattern Applied to Each File:

**Before:**
```tsx
<Layout
  headerProps={{
    title: "Screen Title",
    titleIconSrc: <Icon />,
    showSearch: true,
    searchProps: {
      placeholder: "Search placeholder...",
      onSearch: (query) => console.log("Search:", query),
    },
  }}
>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<Layout
  headerProps={{
    title: "Screen Title",
    titleIconSrc: <Icon />,
  }}
>
```

npm run build
# Result: ✅ Success (37.99s)
